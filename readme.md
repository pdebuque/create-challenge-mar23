# Challenge to self: CREATE

## Background

I am by nature bad at creating things. Actually to be more precise - I'm bad at *finishing* things (I'm great at starting things!). Historically, one of the best motivators for finishing things has been structure (or slightly more cynically, *deadlines*).

So for the next four weeks I am giving myself structure in the form of a creation challenge: make one big thing in the month and two polished little things each week.

## Execution

Some terms must be defined for the sake of structure. What constitutes a project? When is a project completed? What makes a project big or small?

With the knowledge that these are somewhat subject to change, and that  definitions and categorizations here are inherently arbitrary (especially 'big' vs. 'small' - yikes!), I submit these provisional specifications:

A <b>project</b> will be considered a collection of work or thought centered on a single discretely-scoped output. The scope of each project will be documented and included in final publication.

To be considered <b>completed</b>, a project must be:
1. Publication-ready
2. Deployed

"Publication-ready" is a slippery term I am using to mean approx. "in a state I would be happy with a stranger or possible employer seeing".

<b>Big</b> and <b>small</b> are certainly the hand-waviest of these terms. I'm tempted to leave these undefined and let intuition guide the categorization as this project unfolds. However (again for the sake of structure), I will set out with the following:

<b>Big</b> projects either:
- demand greater long-term time investment (a la CS50 course), or
- are of sufficient size to demand greater scoping and planning (wireframes, spikes, etc.) before creation begins.

<b>Small</b> projects are those that can be jumped into with little scoping.

## Possibilities

### big things
- personal website
- CS50 course and project (or major milestones therein)


### small things
- canvas widget site
- article/reflection
- sudoku
- tone.js
- hexagon music
