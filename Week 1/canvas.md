# Canvas projects

Since I first started learning web dev, I've been intrigued by the `<canvas>` element - a sandbox of an HTML element with the tools to empower a broad range of interactive interfaces.

With time on my hands, I'm going to finally dive into the canvas.

## goals

Tempting as it is to simply explore and dive into rabbit holes as they appear, I am bound by this challenge to scope myself responsibly. Here are some things I want to accomplish with canvas:

- drag-and-drop user interface (click a box, on release have it snap into a grid)
- physics engine/sandbox
-  React/Typescript integration

For the purposes of this project, I will create a small physics sandbox in React/Typescript. 

**Base mode:**
- simple gravity/bouncing physics
- user can adjust environmental variables
- user can add objects
- UI involves drag-and-drop interface 
- deployed to Heroku

**Stretch mode:**
- planetary gravity simulator (instead of objects falling to the ground)
- enhanced UI for adding elements to the sandbox
